User sign in process, V1.0


User accounts:
	teacher role
Admin will be handled manually by us through the console.

1. [optionally, teacher requests account, request is forwarded to admin]

2. admin sets up account for teacher
	by email address
	via console

3. teacher gets invitation email, with unique link. temporary password?

4. following link, teacher confirms account and is redirected to profile info page.
	after signup is complete the following is required:
		first/last name
		display name
		password
	the following is optional:
		cell phone #

5. teacher can later return to site and sign in again with email/password

6. teacher can later edit profile info

Implementation:
	We'll use devise for authentication. a devise-style user account will handle sign-in
	we'll use the 'Confirmable' module to act as an invitation email
	required information will have a conditional validation based on registration confirmation


Future considerations:
	admin user role
